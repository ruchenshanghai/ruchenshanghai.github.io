 distribution.<br />
Discrete random variables -> probability mass function (PMF), joint probability distribution, normalized, uniform distribution.<br />
Continuous variables -> probability density function (PDF).
Marginal probability.<br />
Conditional probability, intervention query, casual modeling.
Chain rule, product rule.<br />
