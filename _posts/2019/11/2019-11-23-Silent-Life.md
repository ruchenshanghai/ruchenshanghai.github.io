Unsupervised learning / Supervised Learning


Unsupervised learning: density estimation, draw samples, denoise data, find a manifold, cluster data. Lower dimension, sparse, independent representation. Disentangle the unknown factors of variation. K-means cluster, k dimensional one-hot code, k different centroids, alternating steps until convergence. \\
Stochastic Gradient Descent: cost function, minibatch. Machine learning algorithm: dataset, cost function, optimization, model. \\
Curse of dimensionality, smoothness prior, local constancy prior, local kernels, k nearest neighbor, input O(k) regions at least O(k) examples. Non-local generalization, additional assumptions about data generation distribution. \\
Manifold learning: connected region, a small number of degrees of freedom or dimension, manifold hypothesis, neighborhood, transformation.
