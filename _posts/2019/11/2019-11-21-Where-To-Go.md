Neural Network & Machine Learning

Deep learning:\\
Maximum likelihood estimation, KL divergence, cross entropy, conditional log-likelihood, mean squared error. Maximum likelihood: consistency, statistic efficiency, parametric case.\\
Bayesian statistics, frequentist statistics, prior probability distribution, Bayesian linear regression, posterior. Maximum A Posterior Estimation (MAP).\\
Logistic regression, negative log-likelihood (NLL), Support Vector Machine, kernel trick, Gaussian kernel, radial basis function (RBF), kernel machines, kernel methods, support vector, k-nearest neighbor regression, decision tree.
